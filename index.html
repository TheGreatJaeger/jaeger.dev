    <h1>Introduction</h1>
       <p>Welcome to my site! I am Jaeger, a passionate wannabe linguist (I guess programmer but that's so far down the backburner that I'll barely mention it here) dedicated to the study of languages and their structures.</p>

<h2>About Me</h2>
    <p>
Hi, I'm Jaeger. I've been interested in Linugistics for going on 5 years from this point (June 2024), and my research tends to focus on Slavic Language and they're unique structure.
